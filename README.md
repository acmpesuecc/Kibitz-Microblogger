# Kibitz-Microblogging-Application
## Introduction
People now-a-days use a lot of applications such as instagram, facebook and whatnot to blog posts and reach out to people from around the world. This is a similar blogging application that allows users to post their blogs and media and connect with people from around the world!

## The Design
It's a simple design that consist of around 12 pages, each one can be seen as you traverse through the project. The Java source files can be found in the src-> main java folders as you flow through the file stream, and the XML files are in the res folder. An optional (not-editable) UI_Design link is provided which can be ignored for the time being

## Your Task
- Try to improvise the Android UI design to make it more user friendly
- Create new features in the application by adding in more options 
- Fix certain issues related to the existing model
- Improvise on the linking from page to page

## Difficulty
Might be a little tricky in the beginning but should be fine for those who have a stronghold on JAVA
